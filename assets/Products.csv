High-performance 650-fill duck down insulation provides the DownMat Lite with an R-value of 5.9

The DownMat Lite employs separated air chambers to provide 2.0 inches of comfortable support, while raised air-only outer cells keep you centered on the pad. High-performance 75 denier fabric is air tight, slip proof and offers both UV and abrasion resistance. A layer of duck down insulation laminated to the bottom and top of each baffled air chamber eliminates cold spots.

Glues used in sleeping pad construction are often broken down by moisture, but Exped's proprietary fabric lamination process creates air tight baffles and prevents moisture build up in the pad from destroying these glues, resulting in no loss of air over time. The DownMat Lite features a single FlatValve for inflation and deflation. Many inflatable sleeping pads fail due to their valve construction, but Exped's FlatValve technology eliminates the stiff edge commonly found around traditional valves. This results in lasting, durable valve construction for the life of the pad.","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rectangular","","","","","","","","Usually Ships in 2 to 3 Weeks","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Backpacking","","","","","","","Unisex","","","","","Exped","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5.9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2","Down","","","","","","","","","","1 to 1.49","","","","","","","","","","","",""
